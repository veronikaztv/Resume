    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Making brands look good online is my thing. Think of me as the whole marketing department — in one box. <br />
        I’m a passionate SEO and digital marketing specialist with hands-on experience helping businesses—from local startups to growing agencies—build strong online presence and drive real results. I don’t just focus on rankings (although I love a good keyword win). I look at the bigger picture—how every part of a brand’s digital presence works together. From building WordPress websites and managing social media, to running paid ad campaigns and creating eye-catching visuals—I make sure every piece aligns with business goals.<br/></p>
